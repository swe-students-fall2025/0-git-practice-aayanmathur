[Article: Meta CTO predicts AI will create 'haves and have-nots' in software engineering](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-andrew-bosworth-predictions-ai-impact-on-software-engineering-2025-8)

## Reflection 

The article presents some compelling predictions from Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth about the future of software engineering. Bosworth believes the profession will soon become "a tale of haves and have-nots," creating a clear divide between developers who master AI tools and those who don't. This prediction resonates with me based on what I'm seeing in the current industry landscape. Being a successful software engineer today increasingly requires understanding how to effectively leverage AI tools, and I expect this trend will only accelerate.


The article also highlights Mark Zuckerberg's belief that by the end of this year, Meta and other major companies will have AI systems capable of functioning "as a sort of midlevel engineer." As someone just starting my career, this timeline feels somewhat daunting. However, I don't believe AI will completely replace skilled engineers. Instead, I think we're moving toward a future where the most valuable engineers will be those who can work alongside AI tools effectively, using them to amplify their capabilities rather than being replaced by them. The key will be developing skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.

## Jack Chen's Comment

Very insightful article, it makes me rethink my path in computer science and what being a software engineer means today. I agree with Bosworth that there will be a big gap between those who use AI tools and those who don’t, and learning them will be important. While Zuckerberg’s idea that AI could work like a mid-level engineer soon feels worrying, I believe the future is about working with AI and building skills that make us better by using AI, not being replaced by it.
